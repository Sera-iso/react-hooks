# Lifting state

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/03.md`

## Background

A common question from React beginners is how to share state between two sibling
components. The answer is to
["lift the state"](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components)
which basically amounts to finding the lowest common parent shared between the
two components and placing the state management there, and then passing the
state and a mechanism for updating that state down into the components that need
it.

Lift the state - recap

- When you want to coordinate two components (e.g. 2 panels), move their state to their lowest common parent (e.g. the accordion).
- Then pass the information down through props from their common parent.
- Finally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parent’s state.
- It’s useful to consider components as “controlled” (driven by props) or “uncontrolled” (driven by local state).

## Exercise

👨‍💼 Peter told us we've got a new feature request for the `Display` component. He
wants us to display the `animal` the user selects. But that state is managed in
a "sibling" component, so we have to move that management to the lowest common
parent (`App`) and then pass it down.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 colocating state

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.js)

As a community we’re pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
One thing that we typically have trouble remembering to do is to push state back
down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

The principle of colocation is:
Place code/state as close to where it's relevant as possible.
Ask yourself "do I really need the modal's status (open/closed) state to be in Redux?" (the answer is probably "no"). Colocate your state and you'll find yourself with a faster*, simpler* codebase.
Faster because the global state doesn't have to re-render if the local modal status changes.
Simplier because I don't have to pass props or update props in other components. All changes happen locally in the component where conditions are defined.

👨‍💼 Peter told us that now users only want the animal displayed instead of the
name:

```javascript
function Display({animal}) {
  return <div>{`Your favorite animal is: ${animal}!`}</div>
}
```

You'll notice that just updating the `Display` component to this works fine, but
for the extra credit, go through the process of moving state to the components
that need it. You know what you just did for the `Animal` component? You need to
do the opposite thing for the `Name` component.
